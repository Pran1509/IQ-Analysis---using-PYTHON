# IQ Analysis - Brain, Height, Weight, and PIQ Study

## Project Title
IQ Analysis - Statistical Study on Brain Size, Height, Weight, and PIQ

## Description
This project performs statistical analysis on a dataset containing brain size, height, weight, and PIQ (Performance IQ) measurements. The analysis includes descriptive statistics and standard deviation plots for key variables. The project visualizes data distribution and measures central tendency, helping understand relationships between the variables.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install the required dependencies using:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

### Installing
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/IQAnalysis.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd IQAnalysis
   ```
3. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python analysis.py
   ```

## Running the Tests
### Breakdown of Tests
- The script automatically calculates statistical values such as mean, median, mode, and standard deviation.
- It generates scatter plots with standard deviation bands to visualize data spread.

## Deployment
This project does not require deployment. Simply run the Python script in a local development environment.
